# Vanderbilt University MATH 2820L Final Project

### Counties at risk for police killings based on racial composition and GDP
### Jeffrey Cheng, Ruida Zeng, & Arjun Bansal 4/7/2019

**Contributions**: 

Arjun: came up with idea of data set, found data sets, and manipulated them to have the right FIPS code and data in columns that matched up like we needed 

Jeffrey: wrote the code that combined the police killings and other data sets & wrote the paper 

Ruida: wrote the code for the models & made inferential conclusions on the results of the models

**INTRODUCTION**: We analyzed a data set we found on fivethirtyeight on police killings throughout the United States and tried to find some correlations between the number of police killings and the racial composition and GDP of each location which we differentiated with their unique FIPS code. We used our results to look at the data sets of demographic data and identify which counties are at risk for police killings. This project will be useful to someone because it could help them figure out appropriate places for them to live if safety is of high priority to them. It could also be useful to city governments in evaluating how much training regarding self-defense needs to be given to their police force.

**DATA**: Our police killings data was obtained from fivethirtyeight and contains all unintentional killings of people by police in 2015 along with name, county, and various county statistics. The GCP_Release_1 dataset countains a list of all the counties in the US with their GDP for 4 categories: total, private goods, private services, and government. The cc-est2017-alldata dataset contains population estimates for every county with categories of total population, white male, white female, black male, black female, etc.
